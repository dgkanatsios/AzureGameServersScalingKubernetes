# AzureGameServersScalingKubernetes

Scaling dedicated game servers is hard. They're stateful, can't (well, shouldn't) be explicitly shut down (since players might be still enjoying their game) and, as a rule of thumb, their connection with the players must be of minimal latency, especially for real-time games.

This repository aims to provide a solution for managing containerized dedicated game servers on Azure Platform using the managed [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).

~ This is currently a work in progress. ABSOLYTELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE ~

## Architecture

We are using [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) to represent our dedicated game servers. Specifically, we have two core entities:

- DedicatedGameServer ([YAML](/artifacts/crds/dedicatedgameserver.yaml), [Go](/pkg/apis/azuregaming/v1alpha1/dedicatedgameserver.go)): represents the game server itself. You may find referenced as DGS in the source code. Each DedicatedGameServer has a corresponding Pod which will run the Docker container for your game. We are using Kubernetes `hostPort` to run the dedicated game servers. Ports are bound automatically via a custom portregistry object.
- DedicatedGameServerCollection ([YAML](/artifacts/crds/dedicatedgameservercollection.yaml), [Go](/pkg/apis/azuregaming/v1alpha1/dedicatedgameservercollection.go)): represents a collection of related DedicatedGameServers. These game servers can be scaled in/out, share a common container image and are created as a set/collection.

Project is composed of 3 Docker images:

- OpenArena: contains the demo game server, from open source game [OpenArena](http://openarena.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)
- APIServer: this is the API server for our project, allows the game server to call some basic REST APIs to signal that the game server is running/failed and inform about the number of the active players
- controller: this contains custom [Kubernetes controllers](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller) for our CRDs. These controllers will perform various activities on the system when DedicatedGameServerCollections or DedicatedGameServers are created

### Docker Hub Images

Beforementioned images are hosted on Docker Hub

- [OpenArena for Kubernetes](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgkanatsios/docker_openarena_k8s/)
- [API Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgkanatsios/aks_gaming_apiserver/)
- [Custom Kubernetes Controller](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgkanatsios/aks_gaming_controller/)

### Autoscaler

Project contains an **experimental** Pod autoscaler, you can find it in the AutoScalerController file and you can configure it when deploying your DedicatedGameServerCollection resource. This autoscaler (if enabled) will scale in/out the DedicatedGameServers in the collection based on the `ActivePlayers` metric. Each game server can hold a specific amount of players, if more of them are lining up in our matchmaking server, then we are clearly in need of more DedicatedGameServer instances (and their corresponding Pods).
